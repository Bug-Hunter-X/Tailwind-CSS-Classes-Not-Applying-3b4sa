```javascript
//Ensure your Tailwind configuration is correct. Check your `tailwind.config.js` file.
//Check for conflicting styles by inspecting the browser's developer tools to ensure no other style is overriding Tailwind's.
//Verify correct import and application of the styles:
//Add !important to the class temporarily to see if it works
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4 !important">
  <p>This text should be red and have padding.</p>
</div>
//If it works, there is a higher specificity style overriding it. Find and adjust it.
//If it still does not work, there may be a problem in your Tailwind setup.
