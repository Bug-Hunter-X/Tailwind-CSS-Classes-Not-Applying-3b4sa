# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS: classes not applying as expected.  The problem lies in the incorrect application or conflict with other CSS rules.

## Problem
The provided HTML snippet attempts to apply the `bg-red-500` (red background) and `p-4` (padding) Tailwind CSS classes to a div element, yet the styles are not rendered correctly. This may be caused by several factors:

* **Incorrect Tailwind CSS setup:** Ensure Tailwind is correctly configured in your project and that the styles are being injected into your CSS file.
* **CSS Specificity:** Other CSS rules may have higher specificity and are overriding Tailwind's classes.
* **Typographical errors:** Double-check that the class names are spelled correctly and that there are no extra spaces or characters.
* **Conflicting styles:**  Another stylesheet may be conflicting with Tailwind CSS.

## Solution
The solution addresses potential causes by carefully checking configuration, specificity, and any conflicting styles.
